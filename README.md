# Game Test Swing
A game I made in 2016 using Java Swing as the rendering

## Game Settings
The game controls and framerate can be changed using the second dialog window

### Controls
WASD is the default movement controls

### Framerate
The default is 60fps, but can be changed from 5 to 240 with a 5 incremental steps, the player can remove the limit by setting it to the lowest 0 value
